**Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Streamlit App**

This project presents a thorough analysis of the Breast Cancer dataset, utilizing feature selection, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, and hyperparameter tuning through Grid Search Cross-Validation. Additionally, it includes a Streamlit app that enables interactive exploration of the dataset, evaluation of the model's performance, and making predictions.

The app offers:

- **A detailed dataset overview** with visualizations of key features.
- **Interactive model evaluation tools**, including the confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.
- **A simple prediction interface** to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## **Dataset Overview**:
Show the structure and display a sample of the Breast Cancer dataset.

## **Feature Selection**:
Use the SelectKBest method to select the most important features for the model.

## **Feature Importance Visualization**:
Create visualizations of the top 25 features based on their F-scores.

## **Model Training and Evaluation**:
Train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using MLPClassifier, optimize hyperparameters with Grid Search Cross-Validation, and evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.

## **Interactive Tabs**:
- **Make a Prediction**: Input feature values to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
- **Model Evaluation**: View detailed performance metrics and visualizations of the model.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore feature distributions, class distributions, scatterplots, and correlation heatmaps.

## **Interactive Visualizations**:
- **Feature distributions**.
- **Correlation heatmap**.
- **Class distribution bar chart**.
- **Pairwise scatterplots with color-coded classes**.
